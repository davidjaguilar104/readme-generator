## Description   

This is my first application built using Node.js. I also utilized the Inquirer package in order to get user input in a more efficient manner. I wanted to build this project to demonstrate my skills using Node.js and NPM. This application can also be really useful for my fellow developers. My application will help you generate a README.md for any project you have! Feel free to use this application and spend more time developing rather than on your README.md for your projects!

## Walkthrough Video   

This will be a link to the video showing how the app works

## Installation

In order to use this application you must clone the repository first. After you have cloned the repo to your local machine you must then open your terminal on your machine. Once the terminal is open you must navigate into the directory where you cloned this repository and then navigate into the folder named "readme-generator". Next, you will have to type the command "npm install" (making sure you are in the "readme-generator" directory) to install all the required dependencies this application uses such as Inquirer. Finally, the application will be invoked using the following command: 
"node index.js"
You should then have everything installed and be able to use the application. You will be prompted questions and once all questions are answered a README.md file will be generated and you can find it in the projects root directory!
